						When "simple" things you have done 100 times before stop working that can be a very frustrating experience. It just wont work and you cant see any reason why. For example if you place the snippit above in the head of every page of your jQuery Mobile site or app. You might be suprised to know it will only work on the very first page!

					<h2>Lets explore the concept of pages in jquery mobile first</h2>
					<ul>
						<h3 class="fragment">Some general things to remember</h3>
						<li class="fragment">By default all pages are loaded via AJAX</li>
						<li class="fragment">Pages are pulled into the current DOM to allow transitions</li>
						<li class="fragment">Pages can be cached and remain in the DOM or removed after they are hidden</li>

					<h2>What exactly is a page in jQuery Mobile?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">A page is any div with a data-role of page</li>
						<li class="fragment">There can be one or more pages in single document</li>
						<li class="fragment">Pages can be dynamicly injected, pulled via ajax, or navigated to with a normal http request</li>

						<li>There can be one or more pages in single document</li>
						<li>Pages can be dynamicly injected, pulled via ajax, or navigated to with a normal http request</li>
						but in simple terms a page is exactly what it sounds like one page of your application or site. the differences are basicly just that you can have more then one in a single document and that most are pulled via AJAX.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Now a very brief overview of the AJAX nav model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">The first page is always requested via a normal HTTP request</li>
						<li class="fragment">By default all navigation in jQuery Mobile is handled via changes to
							<code class="notranslate">location.hash</code>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">When the history api is avalible in the browser the pushState plugin is used to maintain a clean and transparent url structure</li>
					</ul>

						<li>Now a very brief overview of the AJAX nav model</li>
						<li>The first page is always requested via a normal HTTP request</li>

							<code class="notranslate">location.hash</code>
						</li>
						<li>When the history api is avalible in the browser the pushState plugin is used to maintain a clean and transparent url structure</li>
						By doing this jQuery mobile is able to provide app like page transitions and the ability to run in iOS web-app-capible mode but still allow navigation via the back button or refresh to act as expected. Because jQuery mobile uses a standard symantic link structure it also makes your app or site degrade gracefully when javascript or AJAX are not avalible. 
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>At the core of the AJAX nav model is the <code class="notranslate">changePage</code> function</h2>
					<h4><code class="notranslate">changePage</code> is used to change pages programaticly and internally anytime a link is clicked</h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The basic steps in a change page are</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Examin the url to see if it points to an internal or external page</li>
						<li class="fragment">If the page is internal transition to that page</li>
						<li class="fragment">If the page is external load the page via AJAX then transition</li>
						<li class="fragment">If the page is cross domain or has <code class="notranslate" >data-ajax="false"</code> the page will load via a normal http request</li>
					</ol>

						<li>If the page is cross domain or has <code class="notranslate" >data-ajax="false"</code> the page will load via a normal http request</li>
						It is possible to over ride the cross domain behivor via the allow cross domain pages configureation option. This is for if your in an enviroment that does not enforce cross domain policy like inside a cordova / phonegap app

						Now lets take a look at page events.
					</h1>
					<p>No matter what stage in a pages lifecycle you need to bind to.</p>
					<p>there is an event for you</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now lets take a look at page events.
						No matter what stage in a pages lifecycle you need to bind to.
						there is an event for you
						Its true too jQuery mobile provides 14 different events that you can hook to to allow you to bind to any stage of the pages lifcycle to trigger your own scripts. It dosent matter if you are worried about loading, initalizing, createing, transitioning, or removing the page we have the event your looking for.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="font-size:100px;">Page Load Events<br/>(in order of execution)</h1>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagebeforeload</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">**pageload</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">**pageloadfailed</code></h2></li>
					</ol>
					<p><small>** Pagebeforeload will trigger followed by either pageload or pageloadfailed based on the out come</p></small>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Page Load Events</li>
						<li>pagebeforeload</li>
						<li>**pageload</li>
						<li>**pageloadfailed</li>
						These are all events fired by the page load function this function can be called at any time to load a page and is also called internally by the changepage function when a page needs to be loaded.
						The page load events allow you to hook into and modify the page loading behivor. For example if you want to handle the page load your self you can call preventDefualt() on the event and handle it yourself or if you want to trigger a special action when a page fails to load you can do that too.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="font-size:100px;">Page Change Events<br/>(in order of execution)</h1>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagebeforechange</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">**pagechange</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">**pagechangefailed</code></h2></li>
					</ol>
					<p><small>** Pagebeforechange will trigger followed by either pagechange or pagechangefailed based on the out come</p></small>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Page Change Events</li>
						<li>pagebeforechange</li>
						<li>**pagechange</li>
						<li>**pagechangefailed</li>
						The page change events are triggered by the change page function. These events signify the very begining and end of the process of changing pages before change is the very first event fired before any loading. This can be used to modify the parameters of the change page call and do a sort of redirect.  page change or pagechangefailed are the very last event to trigger these fire after all animation has completed and after page show. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="font-size:100px;">Page Transition Events<br/>(in order of execution)</h1>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagebeforeshow</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagebeforehide</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pageshow</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagehide</code></h2></li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Page Transition Events</li>
						<li>pagebeforeshow</li>
						<li>pagebeforehide</li>
						<li>pageshow</li>
						<li>pagehide</li>
						These events encompase the the transition animation. The show events are triggered on the page being transitioned to and the hide events on the page being transitioned from. These are usefull if you need something to be triggered every time a page is shown or hidden as these will be triggered even if the page is already in the dom.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="font-size:100px;">Page Initilization Events<br/>(in order of execution)</h1>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagebeforecreate</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pagecreate</code></h2></li>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pageinit</code></h2></li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Page Initilization Events</li>
						<li>pagebeforecreate</li>
						<li>pagecreate</li>
						<li>pageinit</li>
						These are the most commonly used page events they represent the actual creation of the page in the dom and its enhancement. pagebeforecreate allows you to manipulate the markup before enhancment or widget initalization has had a chance to occure. pagecreate is triggered after the page is inserted into the dom but before enhancement has occured this is most usefull for initalizing custom or 3rd party widgets. pageinit is triggered after all enhancment and initalization has occured. This is the event we recomend binding to as a replacment for document ready because it will be triggered on the page when it is created egardless of AJAX. document ready is only triggered once when the inital page is loaded with http. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 style="font-size:100px;">Page Remove Events<br/>(in order of execution)</h1>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><h2><code class="notranslate">pageremove</code></h2></li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Page Remove Events</li>
						<li>pageremove</li>
						There is only one event to talk about here and that is the pageremove event this is triggered just before a page is removed from the dom. By default jquery mobile removes all dynamicly loaded pages from the dom as soon as the user navigates to another page. This event can be prevented by calling preventdefault and removal will not occure. this same effect can be acheived using the data-dom-cache attribute on the page or globaly with the global configuration options.

					<h2>This brings us to our first set of Gotchas!</h2>
					<img src="img/abd_104.gif" />
				</section>
				<section  data-state="alert">
					<h2>Why is only the first page of my document loaded?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Though you can place more then one page in a single document, you can not pull in a multi-page document via AJAX.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						There is however a subpage plugin avalible to make this possible.
						<a href="https://github.com/ToddThomson/jQuery-Mobile-Subpage-Widget">https://github.com/ToddThomson/jQuery-Mobile-Subpage-Widget</a>

					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Why is only the first page of my document loaded?</li>
						<li>Though you can place more then one page in a single document, you can not pull in a multi-page document via AJAX.</li>
						This one catches up a lot of people. currently the ajax navigation only loads the first div with a data role of page. The standard work around for this is to add data ajax false to your link to cause a full page reload. alternativly there is a plugin avalible to make loading of multi page documents possible. a quick note if you do try and load a multipage document with ajax no error will be triggered it just wont load anything after the first page so if you try to change to one of the other pages it wont be found.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section  data-state="alert">
					<h2>My Script / css only runs if i refresh the page!</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Items in the head of pages loaded via AJAX are not loaded. Only the first page container is loaded <code class="notranslate"><div data-role="page"></div></code>
						<img src="img/abd_81.gif" />
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>My Script / css only runs if i refresh the page!</li>
						<li>Items in the head of pages loaded via AJAX are not loaded. Only the first page container is loaded </li>
						Nothing out of the head of the page is loaded when a page is loaded via ajax. The only execption to this is the title element is pulled to update the current title. The reason for this is complexity of tracking and removing these elements with the pages and the potential to load a script multiple times potentially causing a variety of problems and undesired effects. There are two different ways to handle this situation and we will look at these in a few minutes.

						<li>If you are trying to pass query parameters to an internal or embedded page this is not supported. There are however several plugins avalible to overcome this limitation. </li>
						because the data url of a page is set only once and the way jQuery mobile uses sub page identifiers this is not supported.

						One important note on this workaround is that this sets is local to true for all ajax requests weather or not they are in the manifest. This works currently because is local is only checked  As long as the cache is valid and the status is 0 so it dosent effect uncached results. This may however change in the future breaking applications using this workaround.

						The reason this is not supported is because we use id's to link to other internal pages in multi page documents. though this function will makes a relativly easy workaround if you are supporting android 2.3 or ios5 and you are using fixed toolbars there is a bug in these browsers that causes any programatic scroll to cause any position fixed elements to become completely unresponsive.

					<h2>Option 1: Place your scripts and css that is page specific inside your page container.</h2>
					<p class="fragment">We DO NOT recomend this though it will work for many things it is not good pratice</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code class="notranslate">
&#60;div data-role="page"&#62;
	//put your scripts and css here

					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Option 1: Place your scripts and css that is page specific inside your page container.</li>
						<li>We DO NOT recomend this though it will work for many things it is not good pratice</li>
						There are several reason we do not recomend this. First is it is just bad pratice to put scripts in the body of a page being loaded. Also it wont work in many situations like if the script uses document ready or if the script is intended to run every time the page is shown not just when it is loaded. It is also fairly easy to load or trigger scripts dynaicly. It is also possible to name space all css to only effect the intended page if needed. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Option 2: Refactoring</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Load scripts dynamicly</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code class="notranslate">
$( document ).on("#aboutPage", "pageinit", function() {
	$.getScript("/js/aboutPageScript.js",function(){
		//do stuff with aboutPageScript.js
	});
});
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Load all scripts and initalize based on pageInit</p>
										<pre class="fragment"><code class="notranslate">
$( document ).on("#aboutPage", "pageinit", function() {
		//Run code specific to #aboutPage
});
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Option 2: Refactoring</li>
						<li>your first refactor option is to load all scripts dynamicly you can do this using the get script function triggered on pageinit</li>
						<li>the second refactor option is to Load all scripts in the head and initalize them based on pageInit</li>
						The best practice in jquery mobile is to place all scripts and css in the head of your page and make the head of every document exactly the same execpt for title. This will make it so weather you navigate to a page with AJAX or directly via http the page will load and display the same.
						This will slow down your inital page load a bit but it will make all subsequent page loades faster.

						<li>Dynamic Content & Widgets</li>
						<li>This is the number one area people have trouble with</li>
						This is an area where there are a lot of potential stumbling blocks to run into when your making an app or site. Thats because in jQuery Mobile almost everything you do will involve one or more widgets and as for dynamic content lets define what we mean by dynamic content.

					<h3>Deffinition: Dynamic Content</h3>
					<blockquote>
						Dynamic content is content that is generated at the time of access by a user or that changes as a result of interaction with the user.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>By this deffinition almost all content in a jQuery Mobile website is dynamic</h2>
					A few Examples: 
					<ul>
						<li>A page loaded via AJAX navigation<li>
						<li>Enhanced Form Elements</li>
						<li>A Filtered list view</li>
						<li>Popups</li>
						<li>Any content you inject into a page or manipulate via javaScript</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>A few good things to remember when working with jQuery Mobile widgets</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>All of jQuery Mobile's enhanced form elements are widgets</li>
						<li>Most Widgets in jQuery Mobile enhance the markup</li>
						<li>jQuery Mobile widgets are based on the jQuery UI widget factory<li>
						<li>all jQuery mobile widgets inherit from the mobile base widget</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

							<li>I change the styleing on my button, select etc, but it has no effect</li>
							<li>The element you added is not the element you see</li>
							So far you have heard me talk a lot about enhanced markup or content so let me explain briefly what i mean by this. buttons are a good example when you add a button. The button you see and click in jQuery mobile is not the actual button element added to the page. the native element is hidden wrapped in a div with several spans added as you can see in the example. So if you want to add custom styling to a button or other enhanced element this is what you need to target in your css.

					<aside class="notes">
						<li>I change a css style and it dosent show any change</li>
						<li>Check your css specificity</li>
						Another common css related problem that seems to come up a lot involves css specificity many of the rules in the jquery mobile css stylesheet involve chains of 3 plus classes. to override these rules your rule must have a greater css specificity.

					<h2>I update the value of a select programaticly but the menu dosent change</h2>

					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>I update the value of a select programaticly but the menu dosent change</li>
						<li>When updating a select menu you must call refresh</li>
						This is another one to do with enhanced content. because the element you see on the screen is not the actual select element if you change the select menus value programaticly you must call refresh to force the visual element to refresh with the current select value.
					</aside>

					<pre><code class="notranslate">

$( ".selector" ).slider( "refresh" );
//refresh Radio / Checkbox
$( "button" ).checkboxradio( "refresh" );
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>The last one also goes for Slider, Flip, Radio, Buttons and Checkbox controls</li>
						All of the other enhanced form elements follow the same pattern to refresh there values when you change them programaticly. you must of course use the widget for the type of element your trying to refresh.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>I add more options to a custom select but when i open the menu the options are not avalible</h2>
					<p>When adding options to a custom selecet programaticly you must call refresh with true</p>
					<pre><code class="notranslate">
//refresh and force rebuild
$('select').selectmenu('refresh', true);

					<aside class="notes">
						<li>I add more options to a custom select but when i open the menu the options are not avalible</li>
						<li>When adding options to a custom selecet programaticly you must call refresh with true</li>
						This continues the same theme of updateing enhanced elements. This only effects custom selects because just like with the other enhanced elements the custom select is not the actual element this time to cause a rebuild we pass the refresh a second paramater of true to cause a rebuild.

						<li>Other then the basic border and color styles applied to text inputs jQuery Mobile does not enhance these. Additional control rendering is according to the browser.</li>

					<h2>My range / search input is being changed to type="number" / type="text"</h2>
					<p>These inputs are degraded to type text or number to allow for consistant look and enhancement by jQuery Mobile</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						because different browsers style these differently but they are very commonly used we degrade these to text so that we can then use our own enhancement so that they will be styled consistantly across all browsers
					</aside>

				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>Sometimes my custom select shows as a popup other times a dialog</h2>
					<p>Wether a custom select shows as a dialog or popup is based on the number of options and  the amount of avalible space on the screen</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To give maximum usability in custom select menus and deal with the awkwardness of scrolling with a popup open if the select menu when opened as a popup will not fit on the screen we automaticly create a new page and populate it with a list of the select options the page will open as a dialog.

					<h2>Calling disable on my button does not work</h2>
					<p>Buttons that are created from a link or button element cannot be disabled</p>
					<p>You can however still add the class <code class="notranslate">.ui-disabled</code> via javaScript</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The reason for this is that current w3c specification does not provide for a disabled attribute on buttons or links only for inputs with a type = button.

					<h2>Now lets move on to some more general widget / dynamic content pitfalls for you to escape</h2>
					<img src="img/abd_180.gif"/>
				</section>
				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>Im injecting html into a page but its not being enhanced</h2>
					<p>After you inject new html content into a page you must trigger create on the parent container</p>
					<pre><code class="notranslate">
//HTML 
&#60;form id="formid"&#62;
	&#60;input type="search" id="searchinput"/&#62;
	&#60;button id="submitButton"&#62;Submit&#60;/button&#62;
&#60;/form&#62;
//javaScript
$("#formid").trigger("create");
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you inject new html content into a page if you want it to recieve enhancment from jQuery mobile you must trigger the create event on the container to let the framework know to look for changes and enhance elements as needed.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>Im injecting html into a page and triggering create but its not being enhanced</h2>
					<p>Make sure you are triggering create on the PARENT CONTAINER no the element to be enhanced</p>
					<pre><code class="notranslate">
//HTML 
&#60;form id="formid"&#62;
	&#60;input type="search" id="searchInput"/&#62;
	&#60;button id="submitButton"&#62;Submit&#60;/button&#62;
&#60;/form&#62;
//javaScript **CORRECT**
$("#formid").trigger("create");
//javaScript INCORRECT
$("#serchInput").trigger("create");
$("#submitButton").trigger("create");
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a common mistake when triggering create for a single item. Its easy to think ok im injecting this select element so i will trigger create on it. However create  needs to be triggered on the parent container because jquery mobile will only look within this container and not at the container it self.

				<h1>Now how about for a couple issues involving cloning</h1>
				<img src="img/abd_67.gif"/>	
				</section>
				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>I clone an enhanced element but the clone dosent update or respond as expected</h2>
					<p>When you clone an element you are only cloning the markup not the events that have been bound to it</p>
					<img src="img/abd_216.gif" />
					<p>Instead clone the native element and then enhance it</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This one andthe next one are closely related and have the same solution which is to simply use the native element and then enhance it. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-state="alert">
					<h2>I clone an enhanced element and trigger a widget on it / trigger create and it is double enhanced</h2>
					<img src="img/clonedSelect.jpg"/>
					<p>By cloning the entire enhanced element and then enhancing it again you are "double enhancing" it</p>
					<p>To avoid this only copy the native element then enhance it</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are two main ways to trigger enhancment in situations like this if your dealing with a single element it is more effecient to just call the actual widget your looking for. but if you need to enhance several elements all at once you can just trigger create on the container
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I want to render a piece of content with out jQuery Mobile enhancing it but it happens automaticly!</h2>
					<p>To prevent enhancing any form or button element from being enhanced add <code class="notranslate">data-role="none"</code></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To make writing a jquery mobile site or app as simple and symantic as possible all content is enhanced automaticly with no need to write any javascript. However we do of course provide different methods to overirde this the simplest if its only for an individual elements is to just add data-role="none"
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>I want to stop jQuery Mobile from enhancing an entire block of content</h2>
					<p>Use the attribute <code class="notranslate">data-enhance="false"</code> to stop jQuery mobile from enhancing anything inside the container.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you need a whole block to be passed over durring enhancement data-enhance false is what your looking for this stops anything inside the container from being enhanced. Remember this must be called on a container and not the element itself.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Im using <code class="notranslate">data-enhance="false"</code> but the elements are still enhanced!</h2>
					<p>when using <code class="notranslate">data-enhance="false"</code> you must set <code class="notranslate">$.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled</code> to true prior to initilization</p>
					<pre><code class="notranslate">
$(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){
  //apply overrides here
  $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled = true;
});
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						The biggest pit fall we see with people trying to prevent the enhancement of elements is they set data enhance to false but forget to set the global configuration option ignore content enabled. The reason this has to be turned on in the global configuration is that it is a very expensive. This is because when this option is enabled every element that needs to potentially  be enhanced has to have all of its parents checked to see if they have had data-enhance set to false. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The defaults i configure are being ignored!</h2>
					<p>defaults MUST be configured prior to initalization and before the jQuery Mobile script has been loaded</p>
					<pre><code class="notranslate">
&#60;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
&#60;script&#62;
$(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){
  $.mobile.foo = bar;
});	
&#60;/script&#62;
&#60;script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here is another common mistake to do with overrideing default configuration options. The placment of the overrides in the head of your page is very important. they must be after jquery but before jquery mobile.

					<h2>These are some NASTY bugs</h2>
					<img src="img/the-host.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Device bugs are some of the worst bugs to deal with because they generally have no cause that makes sense and the fixes for them if its possible at all tend to make even less sense then the bugs them selves. Im just going to go over 2 of the more common and troublesome of these bugs and give you some resourcees to explore them more if your intrested.

					<h2>Now for my favorite two nasty device specific issues and trust me these are some nasty ones!</h2>
					<img src="img/abd_6.gif"/>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Position fixed elements become non responsive after a programatic scroll in iOS 5 and android 2.3</h2>
					<p><a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/1">https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/1</a></p>
					<p>A BIG note on this one is that this is also triggered by following a deep link to an id which causes the page to scroll</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This one effects a lot of devices since android 2.3 still has an over 80% adoption and while since ios 6 was released ios 5 numbers are going down it still has substantial market share. The reason behind this issue is that in these browsers though visually the elements appear to remain fixed on the screen. If you check the fixed elements offset from the viewport you will see that it is still in the position it was proior to the scroll taking place. Infact if you scroll and then scroll back to the original location everything will work as expected. This one untill now hasent had much hope. However since in jquery mobile 1.3 we hope to support deeplinking this one has recieved some more attention in the last few weeks and i am happy to say that last week i wrote a new extension to the fixedToolbar widget that will solve this issue its in testing in master now and will hopefully be in version 1.3 along with fixes for several other device specific issues related to fixed positioning
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Android and <code class="notranslate">position:fixed</code> are fundamentally broken in weird ways</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Form elements elsewhere on the page, select menus in particular—can fail to respond to user interaction when an empty absolute positioned element is placed within a fixed position element.</li>
						<li>The above-described issue can also be triggered by an absolute positioned image inside of a fixed position element, but only when that image is using something other than its inherent dimensions.</li>
						<li>When a position: fixed element appears anywhere on a page, most 2D CSS transforms will fail. Oddly, only translate transforms seem uneffected by this</li>
						<li>Combinations position: fixed and overflow properties are best avoided, as both have been known to cause unpredictable issues in older versions of Android OS</li>
						<li>Any element that triggers the on-screen keyboard, when placed inside a position: fixed element, will fail to respond to user input when using anything other than the default keyboard. This includes Swype, XT9 or, it seems, any input method apart from the standard non-predictive keyboard.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Also specific to Android 2.2—this can cause entire pages to fail to respond to user interaction. This can seemingly be solved by adding any character to the absolute positioned element, including a non-breaking space, and in some cases even whitespace.</li>
						<li> If a height or width is specified on the image using CSS, or the image src is invalid (thus having no inherent height and width), this issue can occur. If an image that is inherently, say, 50x50 pixels is placed in a fixed element and left at its inherent dimensions, this issue does not seem to occur.</li>
						<li> Even more oddly, this issue is solved by setting a CSS opacity of .9 or below on the parent of the fixed element.</li>
						This is a personal favorit bug of many members on the team due to the complete non sensical nature of the issue.

					<h2>The #1 thing i would like to leave you with is about what to do when you run into an issue</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Check the docs</li>
						<li>try and simplify your code and see if you can still reproduce the issue</li>
						<li>Ask for help in the forum and on the #jquerymobile channel on irc</li>
						<li>If you think what your running into is a bug in jQuery Mobile or even a device bug file a ticket on the issue tracker on github <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues">https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues</a></li>

					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						<li>Believe it or not most of the common issues people run into are covered in the docs so i suggest this should be your first stop when your investigating an issue look at the approrite sections in the docs and look for any notes.</li>
						<li>by simplifying your code and trying to see what exactly is casuing the issue will help you to identify the exact problem</li>
						<li>The jQuery mobile community is great and always there in the forums and on irc to help you troubleshoot your site or app</li>
